1. The Core Algorithm Logic
You can implement this in your app by scoring these three pillars:
Sentiment Score (NLP): Use a library like TextBlob or NLTK to scrape news headlines or earnings call transcripts.
VZ Context: The algorithm would detect keywords like "$25 billion buyback", "616,000 new subscribers", and "dividend growth".
Rule: If Sentiment_Score > 0.7, bias toward Bullish (Calls).
Momentum Score (Technical): Use TA-Lib or Pandas to calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
VZ Context: After an 11.8% jump, the RSI is likely over 70 (overbought).
Rule: If RSI > 70, flag as "Overextended." This suggests that even if you are bullish, a Call might be too expensive right now, and a Credit Spread might be safer.
Order Flow Score (Options Data): Track the Volume Delta (the difference between buying calls and selling puts).
VZ Context: Massive volume (296% above average) indicates institutional "smart money" entering.
Rule: If Volume_Delta is positive and volume is spiking, the trend is confirmed. 
2. Strategy Selection Flowchart
You can code a simple if-else block to output a recommendation:
IF Sentiment = Positive AND RSI < 70 → Buy a Call (High reward potential).
IF Sentiment = Positive AND RSI > 70 → Sell a Put (CSP) (You get the "overbought" premium but have a safety buffer).
IF Sentiment = Negative AND RSI > 30 → Buy a Put (Capitalize on the decline you anticipated). 
3. Python Libraries for Your App
To build this, you would use this specific "stack":
yfinance: To pull current price and historical data.
TA-Lib: To calculate technical indicators like Moving Averages and RSI.
Stocksent or OpenBB: To automate news sentiment analysis for specific tickers. 
Universal Use: This logic works for any stock. For example, if you ran this for a stock with negative headlines and an RSI of 80, your app would recommend a Bear Put Spread to capitalize on the likely "crash."

1. Buying a Put Option (Simplest Bearish Trade)
Buying a put option is the most direct way to bet against a stock with limited risk. 
How it works: You pay a premium to buy a contract that gains value as the stock price falls.
Maximum Loss: Limited to only the premium you paid.
Profit Potential: High. For every dollar the stock drops below your strike price (minus the premium), you profit $100 per contract.
Example: If VZ is at $44.50, you might buy a $44 Put expiring in 2 weeks. If VZ drops to $40, your put becomes worth at least $4.00, allowing you to sell it for a profit or exercise it. 
2. Bear Put Spread (Cost-Effective) 
If you think VZ will go down but not "crash," a Bear Put Spread reduces your upfront cost.
The Setup: You Buy one put (e.g., $44 strike) and Sell another put at a lower price (e.g., $41 strike).
The Benefit: The money you collect from selling the $41 put helps pay for the $44 put.
The Trade-off: Your profit is capped if the stock falls below the lower strike ($41), but your initial risk is also much lower.
